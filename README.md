# core

This's a resource monitor for Linux, Windows, Mac and Unix, my idea is to create a simple resource monitor modulate,
very simple to create new module, independent and simple loading.

## Motivation

We live in a world where the devices are not known, but, they can talk to each other through the wonderful abstraction layer between them, 
that's great. I belive that in a perfect environment the resource should be monitored and the burden should be distributed meeting the needs 
of the host without disturbing your performance.
